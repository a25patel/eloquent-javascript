# Objects
Complexity can be made manageable by separating it into small pieces that are isolated from each other... objects.

* Methods - interface through which an objects is to be used
* Encapsulation - distinguishing between internal and external Complexity

**Methods are relatively simple, the complexity lies inside the object**

___Methods___
Method needs to do something with the object it was called on. When a function is called as a method __object.method()__, _this_ will point to the object that it was called on.
