# Data Structures
Objects allows us to group values together and build complex Structures

_Methods_
var array = []


push: array.push("hello", "Goodbye")
      array = ["hello", "Goodbye"]
join: array.join(' ');
      hello Goodbye

      array.join(' and ');
      hello and Goodbye
pop: array.pop();
    Goodbye

_Mutability_
impossible to change an existing value of the different types

Objects CAN be modified by changing properties (mutable)
